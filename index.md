## Software worth to have

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/BoolMar/Software-Worth-To-Have/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes
